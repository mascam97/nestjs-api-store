# Nest API Store

_Store of products for a little grocery stores_

## Project goal :goal_net:

**June 2022**: Personal project to learn **JavaScript as Backend with TypeScript and Nestjs**.

### Achievements June 2022 :star2:

As Backend with **PHP - Laravel** I knew everything about an API. So I developed fastly the project by following some online courses, where I achieved:

- Implemented Validations, Services, environment variables, documentation with **Swagger** and more
- Configured **NoSQL with MongoDB for the Database** and **Mongoose as a ODM**
- Implemented **Authentication with Passport.js - JWT**
- Implemented **Authorization with Guards**

### TODOS

**As Backend Developer with experience** I just limited myself to follow the courses and learned, so the project is not stable, and for make it stable I needed first:

- **Project definition**: The course create models like brands, categories, users and roles, it defined its own business logic for learning porpuse. From my experience this **business logic should be well defined with a scope that allows scalability**
- **Testing**: The course just got focused on learning porpuse, everything was tested from Postman despite **in a professional work Test-Driven Development is used**. From my experience, everything must have testing to garantee the functionality and not spend so much time in testing from Postman
- **Project scope**: A personal project should have a defined goal with its scope

## Getting Started :rocket:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites :clipboard:

The programs you need are:

- Nodejs v16.14.2
- NPM v8.5.0
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing üîß

First duplicate the file .env.example as .env.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then install the JavaScript dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Create the images and run the services (MongoDB and MongoExpress):

```
docker compose up
```

Create a database called `nest-api-store` in Mongo Express from 8081 (http://localhost/).

Finally, defines an `API_KEY` in .env file and run the server

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
NODE_ENV=stag npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
NODE_ENV=prod npm run start:dev

```
